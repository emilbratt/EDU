I`ve been wanting to learn a new lanaugage
and the languages I`ve thought about
are C, C# and Rust

Viability, Productivity, Capabilities and Efficiency
have been the main reason for the "why"

After some back and forth comparing
this vs. that, "googling the why"
 and consulting people with with years
of programming/devops experience,
I`ve finally settled on Rust


So why Rust?

I`ve spoken to developers in both the software
and devops field that have years of experience
in programming with C and similar languages

What they all seem to agree on is that Rust is
one of the (if not the) best language when
it comes to its viability, execution-speed,
language growth potential (Rust is fairly new)
and the way Rust handles memory

Looking at what experienced programmers say
regarding the things Rust does exceptionally well:
  -preventing segmentation faults,
  -providing high level of safety for multi-threaded code,
  -being as productive as Python while as efficient as C

Another reason is that Rust is compiled directly
to machine code, unlike C# which is compiled to
bytecode and dependes on a runtime-environment

These reasons as I understand it makes Rust
a good choice if you want your applications
to run on all major platforms like desktop,
servers, handhields, cloud-infrastructures
as well as micro controllers like arduino

Cool, let`s throw in my very first
line of code inside this main function..
