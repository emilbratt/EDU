## Advent of Code - Rust

### Input files

Place your input files here.\
Make sure it has the same name as the solution file.

For example:\
for solution y2024d01p1.rs -> src/solutions/y2024d01p1.rs\
create input y2024d01.in -> ./y2024d01.in

Download input with curl
```sh
# get session cookie (use your browsers inspection tools) and set envar
AOC_SESSION=746c5645f5...........................

# run curl for select year and day, example uses year 2024 and day 1
curl https://adventofcode.com/2024/day/1/input --cookie "session=${AOC_SESSION}" > y2024d01.in
```


### Run solution

Run with `cargo run`.\
All solutions are isolated (no shared code).\
This means that you can copy code directly from the solution file e.g. src/solutions/y2024d01p1.rs\
..and into your crate if you want.


### Disclaimer

I will most likely select the puzzles that are not too hard to solve.
When the first 9-10 puzzle days for 2024 are completed or when they get sufficiently hard,\
then I will pick days from earlier years and solve them :).
