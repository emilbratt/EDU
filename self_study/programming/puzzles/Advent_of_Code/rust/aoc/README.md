## Advent of Code - Rust

* no code yet, just made the template for now.

Run with `cargo run`.\
All solutions are isolated (no shared code).\
This means that you can copy code directly from the a single solution file and into your crate if you want.

I will most likely select the puzzles that are not to hard to solve.
When the first 9-10 puzzle days for 2024 are completed or when they get sufficiently hard,\
then I will pick days from earlier yers and solve them :).
