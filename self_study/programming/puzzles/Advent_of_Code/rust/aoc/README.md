## Advent of Code - Rust

*no code yet, just made the template for now.

Run with `cargo run`.
All solutions are isolated (no shared code).
This means that you can copy code directly from the solutions file and into your crate if you want.

I will most likely select the puzzles that are not to hard to solve.
When the first 9-10 puzzle days for 2024 are completed over or when they get sufficiently hard,\
I will pick days from earlier yers and solve them :).
