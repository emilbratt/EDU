## Advent of Code - Rust

* no code yet, just made the template for now.

Place your input files here.

Make sure it has the same name as the solution file.

For example:\
for solution y2024d01p01.rs -> src/solutions/y2024d01p01.rs\
create input y2024d01p01.in -> ./y2024d01p01.in

Run with `cargo run`.\
All solutions are isolated (no shared code).\
This means that you can copy code directly from the solution file and into your crate if you want.

I will most likely select the puzzles that are not too hard to solve.
When the first 9-10 puzzle days for 2024 are completed or when they get sufficiently hard,\
then I will pick days from earlier years and solve them :).
